# File Operations Skill

Use these tags to work with files:

## Tags
- `<read>path/to/file</read>` - Read file contents
- `<write>path/to/file</write>content here</write>` - Write content to file  
- `<search>pattern</search>` - Search for pattern in current directory

## Examples
- `<read>main.go</read>` - Read the main.go file
- `<write>test.txt</write>Hello World</write>` - Create test.txt with "Hello World"
- `<search>func main</search>` - Find all occurrences of "func main"
